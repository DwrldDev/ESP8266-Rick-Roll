# ESP8266-Rick-Roll
Creating a ap to then display a ASCII image of Rick Astley.

I will soon make the same script for my micropython people!.

Installing the esp8266 on arduino can be found here on the docs:

```
https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html
```
Or you may proceed to watch a video tutorial on so.



I created this script for a prank on friends and family on christmas, Enjoy!!
